    "# Portfolio Analysis using `pyfolio`\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many ways to evaluate and analyze an algorithm. While we already provide you with some of these measures like a cumulative returns plot in the Quantopian backtester, you may want to dive deeper into what your algorithm is doing. For example, you might want to look at how your portfolio allocation changes over time, or what your exposure to certain risk-factors is.\n",
    "\n",
    "At Quantopian, we built and open-sourced [`pyfolio`](http://quantopian.github.io/pyfolio/) for exactly that purpose. In this notebook you will learn how you can use this library from within the Quantopian research environment (you can also use this library independently, see the [pyfolio website](http://quantopian.github.io/pyfolio/) for more information on that).\n",
    "\n",
    "At the core of pyfolio, we have *tear sheets* that summarize information about a backtest. Each tear sheet returns a number of plots, as well as other information, about a given topic. There are five main ones:\n",

    "* Transactional tear sheet\n",
    "* Bayesian tear sheet\n",

    "\n",
    "In addition, we will pass in a keyword argument called `live_start_date`. The use-case for this feature is that you might have deployed this algorithm and want to see how the out-of-sample period measures up to your backtest. Although it currently is not possible to access returns from live-traded algorithms in research, you could still note the date when you deployed it and run a new backtest over the full time period. This date can be passed with `live_start_date`. Lets pretend that we developed and deployed this algorithm on `2014-1-1`. As I had access to 10 years of historical data, I could have easily overfit my algorithm to only work well on that time period. In fact, it is very difficult *not* to overfit, so comparing in-sample and out-of-sample (OOS) data is a good way to look at that.\n",

    "\n",
    "The main benefit of these methods is **uncertainty quantification**. All the values you saw above, like the Sharpe ratio, are just single numbers. These estimates are noisy because they have been computed over a limited number of data points. So how much can you trust these numbers? You don't know because there is no sense of uncertainty. That is where Bayesian statistics helps as instead of single values, we are dealing with probability distributions that assign degrees of belief to all possible parameter values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Lets create the Bayesian tear sheet. Under the hood this is running MCMC sampling in [`PyMC3`](http://pymc-devs.github.io/pymc3/) to estimate the posteriors which can take quite a while (that's the reason why we don't generate this by default in `create_full_tear_sheet()`)."

    "\n",
    "* The first one is the Bayesian cone plot that is the result of a summer internship project of Sepideh Sadeghi here at Quantopian. It's similar to the cone plot you already saw at in the tear sheet above but has two critical additions: (i) it takes uncertainty into account (i.e. a short backtest length will result in a wider cone), and (ii) it does not assume normality of returns but instead uses a [Student-T distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Student%27s_t-distribution) with heavier tails.\n",
    "* The next row is comparing mean returns of the in-sample (backest) and OOS (forward) period. As you can see, mean returns are not a single number but a (posterior) distribution that gives us an indication of how certain we can be in our estimates. As you can see, the green distribution on the left side is much wider representing our increased uncertainty due to having less OOS data. We can then calculate the difference between these two distributions as shown on the right side. The grey lines denote the 2.5% and 97.5% percentiles. Intuitively, if the right grey line is lower than 0 you can say that with probability > 97.5% the OOS mean returns are below what is suggested by the backtest. The model used here is called [BEST](http://www.indiana.edu/~kruschke/BEST/BEST.pdf) and was developed by John Kruschke.\n",
    "* The next couple of rows follow the same pattern but are an estimate of annual volatility, Sharpe ratio and their respective differences.\n",
    "* The 5th row shows the effect size or the difference of means normalized by the standard deviation and gives you a general sense how far apart the two distributions are. Intuitively, even if the means are significantly different, it may not be very meaningful if the standard deviation is huge amounting to a tiny difference of the two returns distributions.\n",
    "* The 6th row shows predicted returns (based on the backtest) for tomorrow, and 5 days from now. The blue line indicates the probability of losing more than 5% of your portfolio value and can be interpeted as a Bayesian VaR estimate.\n",
    "* Lastly, a Bayesian estimate of annual alpha and beta. In addition to uncertainty estimates, this model, like all above ones, assumes returns to be T-distributed which leads to more robust estimates than a standard linear regression would.\n",
